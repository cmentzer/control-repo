## site.pp ##

# This file (/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp) is the main entry point
# used when an agent connects to a master and asks for an updated configuration.
#
# Global objects like filebuckets and resource defaults should go in this file,
# as should the default node definition. (The default node can be omitted
# if you use the console and don't define any other nodes in site.pp. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.)

## Active Configurations ##

# Disable filebucket by default for all File resources:
#http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/release_notes.html#filebucket-resource-no-longer-created-by-default
File { backup => false }

# DEFAULT NODE
# Node definitions in this file are merged with node data from the console. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.

# The default node definition matches any node lacking a more specific node
# definition. If there are no other nodes in this file, classes declared here
# will be included in every node's catalog, *in addition* to any classes
# specified in the console for that node.


# Node classification is handled in the Puppet Enterprise Console:
#
# Specifically, we assign a variable to a group of nodes in the console 
#   (for example location)
# and then we can classify the nodes based on those variables in the console.
#
# So we assign the "webserver" role (or some other role) to each node on the
# console, and that is the extent of classification. For specific variable assignment
# on each node we use hiera.
